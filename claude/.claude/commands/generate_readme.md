## Automated Project Analysis

### Repository Structure Examination
- Scan directory structure to identify project organization patterns
- Analyze package managers and dependency files to determine technology stack
- Identify configuration files for different environments and deployment methods
- Locate existing documentation files, changelogs, or contributor guides
- Find testing frameworks, build scripts, and deployment configurations

### Code Analysis for Documentation
- Examine entry points and main application files to understand project flow
- Identify key APIs, interfaces, or public methods that should be documented
- Scan for environment variables, configuration options, and customization points
- Find examples, demo files, or sample configurations within the codebase
- Analyze testing patterns to understand expected usage and behavior

### Development Environment Detection
- Identify required runtime versions, language versions, or platform requirements
- Find development tools, linters, formatters, or quality assurance tools
- Detect containerization, virtualization, or development environment setup
- Identify database requirements, external service dependencies, or system requirements
- Find scripts for building, testing, deploying, or maintaining the project

### Integration and Dependency Analysis
- Analyze package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, or equivalent dependency declarations
- Identify external APIs, services, or systems that the project integrates with
- Find configuration templates, environment setup files, or deployment scripts
- Detect monitoring, logging, or observability integrations
- Identify security tools, authentication providers, or compliance requirements
